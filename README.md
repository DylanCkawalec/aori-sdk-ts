Aori is a high-performance orderbook protocol for high-frequency trading on-chain and facilitating OTC settlement. This repository provides a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Aori API to help developers integrate and build on top of the protocol as easily as possible.

This SDK is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

# Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @aori-io/sdk
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @aori-io/sdk
```

## Connecting via HTTP and Websockets

Currently, the Aori API supports both HTTP and Websocket-based connections.

One may be familiar with one or the other or both, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

### HTTP
The `AoriHttpProvider` class is the base class for HTTP-based connections.
```typescript
import { AoriHttpProvider } from "@aori-io/sdk";
const provider = new AoriHttpProvider(...);
```

### Websocket
The `AoriProvider` class is the base class for Websocket-based connections.
```typescript
import { AoriProvider } from "@aori-io/sdk";
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
```

Requests and responses may come back in an asynchronous manner, hence the use of an `Id`. The `AoriProvider` class is an event-based class that is built to handle this, managing requests through the use of a `counter`, but this is not required in the `AoriHttpProvider` for which requests and responses are made in order.

```
Request:
aori_makeOrder(id = 63, ...)

Corresponding response:
{
  id: 63,
  result: ...
}
```

Specifically, the `AoriProvider` also inherits the `EventEmitter` class, meaning that it will emit events when the responses of requests and notifications (where no request was made to receive) are made.
```typescript
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
provider.on(NotificationEvents.OrderToExecute, (...) => {
  ...
});
```

# Key Functionalities

There are a number of key functionalities that can be performed using the SDK. Examples are accompanied by code snippets below.

## Order Creation and Management

### Creating a Limit Order

Limit orders are the first class citzen of the Aori protocol, based off the traditional limit order. A limit order object can be created via the helper function `createLimitOrder` provided.

```typescript
const offerer = "0x...";
const inputToken = "0x...";
const inputAmount = '1000000000000000000'; // Selling 1 unit of token A
const outputToken = "0x...";
const outputAmount = '1000000000000000000'; // Buying 1 unit of token B
const chainId = 5;

const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
...
...
const order = await provider.createLimitOrder({
    offerer,
    inputToken,
    outputToken,
    inputAmount,
    outputAmount,
    chainId,
});
```

It should be noted that this does not actually publish the limit order into the Aori orderbook - it only creates the order object locally to format it correctly before it is sent off. 

### Publishing a Limit Order

To publish a limit order, the method `makeOrder` can be used. Upon success, the limit order will be published live onto the orderbook for another user or trader to take.
```typescript
const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
...
...
const order = await provider.createLimitOrder(...);
...
...
...
await provider.makeOrder({ order: order, chainId: chainId, isPrivate: false });
```

### Cancelling a Limit Order

To cancel a limit order, the method `cancelOrder` can be used. Upon success, the limit order will be cancelled from the orderbook for another user or trader to take.
```typescript
const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const orderId = "...";
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
...
...
await provider.cancelOrder({ orderId: orderId, chainId: chainId });
```

## Orderbook Queries

### Querying the Orderbook
To view any public orders available to take on the orderbook, the method `viewOrderbook` can be used. This will provide a snapshot of the orderbook with the provided filter. If no filter is given, the entire orderbook will be returned (within pagination limits).
```typescript
const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
...
...
provider.on(AoriMethods.ViewOrderbook, (orders) => {
    ...
});
...
await provider.viewOrderbook({});
```

### Subscribing to the Orderbook

Alternatively, one can utilise the subscription to global orderbook events. By default, this is provided. Relevant events for the updating of the state of public orders will be emitted to allow clients to manage a local view of the orderbook for their own purposes.

All relevant orderbook events are under the enum `SubscriptionEvents`.
```typescript
const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
// Subscribe to the feed to receive updates
provider.subscribe();
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderCreated, (order) => {
    ...
});
...
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderCancelled, (order) => {
    ...
});
...
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderTaken, (order) => {
    ...
});
...
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderFulfilled, (orderHash) => {
    ...
});
...
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderToExecute, (order) => {
    ...
})
...
```

## Order Taking, Execution and Settlement

### Taking an Order

A market taker can take an order by calling the `takeOrder` method.

```typescript
const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const makerOrderHash = "...";
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
const seatId = 0;
...
...
...
const takerOrder = await provider.createLimitOrder(...); // Make a matching limit order
...
...
await provider.takeOrder({ orderHash: makerOrderHash, order: takerOrder, chainId, seatId });
```

### Executing an Order

As a market maker (or a market taker if the market maker has chosen not to make the settlement transaction), you will need to execute to settle the orders on-chain and process the non-custodial exchange of assets.

This requires interaction with the on-chain smart settlement contract at `AORI_ZONE_ADDRESS`.

```typescript
import { SubscriptionEvents } from "@aori-io/sdk";
import { Signature } from "ethers";

const chainId = 5; // Goerli
const provider = new AoriProvider(...);
...
...
...
provider.on(SubscriptionEvents.OrderToExecute, async ({ to, value, data }: OrderToExecute) => {
    await provider.sendTransaction({ to, value, data });
});
```

## Template Bots

This SDK also provides a number of standardised bot templates to use for making development quicker. New boilerplates will be added here as more use cases come up and require standardisation - do feel free to contribute!

### BaseMaker

```typescript
import { BaseMaker } from '@aori-io/sdk';

const wallet = new Wallet(...);

const bot = new BaseMaker(...);

bot.on("ready", () => {
  // ...
  await bot.initialise(...);
  // ...
});
```

### QuoteMaker

```typescript
import { QuoteMaker } from '@aori-io/sdk';

const wallet = new Wallet(...);

const bot = new QuoteMaker(...);

bot.on("ready", () => {
  // ...
  await bot.initialise(...);
  // ...
});
```
